/**
 * Q4. Sum of Beautiful Subsequences
 *
 * https://leetcode.cn/contest/weekly-contest-465/problems/sum-of-beautiful-subsequences/
 *
 * You are given an integer array nums of length n.
 *
 * For every positive integer g, we define the beauty of g as the product of g
 * and the number of strictly increasing subsequences of nums whose greatest
 * common divisor (GCD) is exactly g.
 *
 * Return the sum of beauty values for all positive integers g.
 *
 * Since the answer could be very large, return it modulo 1e9 + 7.
