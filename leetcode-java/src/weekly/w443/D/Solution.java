 * 3505. Minimum Operations to Make Elements Within K Subarrays Equal
 *
 * https://leetcode.cn/contest/weekly-contest-443/problems/minimum-operations-to-make-elements-within-k-subarrays-equal/
 *
 * You are given an integer array nums and two integers, x and k.
 *
 * You can perform the following operation any number of times (including zero):
 *
 * Increase or decrease any element of nums by 1.
 *
 * Return the minimum number of operations needed to have at least k non-overlapping
 * subarrays of size exactly x in nums, where all elements within each subarray are equal.
