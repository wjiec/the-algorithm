/**
 * Q4. Number of Stable Subsequences
 *
 * https://leetcode.cn/contest/weekly-contest-467/problems/number-of-stable-subsequences/
 *
 * You are given an integer array nums.
 *
 * A subsequence is stable if it does not contain three consecutive elements with the same parity
 * when the subsequence is read in order (i.e., consecutive inside the subsequence).
 *
 * Return the number of stable subsequences.
 *
 * Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo 1e9 + 7.
