/**
 * Q4. Number of ZigZag Arrays II
 *
 * https://leetcode.cn/contest/weekly-contest-469/problems/number-of-zigzag-arrays-ii/
 *
 * You are given three integers n, l, and r.
 *
 * A ZigZag array of length n is defined as follows:
 *
 * Each element lies in the range [l, r].
 * No two adjacent elements are equal.
 * No three consecutive elements form a strictly increasing or strictly decreasing sequence.
 * Return the total number of valid ZigZag arrays.
 *
 * Since the answer may be large, return it modulo 109 + 7.
 *
 * A sequence is said to be strictly increasing if each element is strictly greater than its previous one (if exists).
 *
 * A sequence is said to be strictly decreasing if each element is strictly smaller than its previous one (if exists).
